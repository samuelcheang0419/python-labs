Fair warning, there are a lot of them, so it's probably better to skim than to really take a deep dive, unless you're loving this stuff."

    "### Writing (Polynomial Class)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will write a `Polynomial` class that acts like a number. As a a reminder, a [polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial) is a mathematical object that looks like $1 + x + x^2$ or $4 - 10x + x^3$ or $-4 - 2x^{10}$. A mathematical polynomial can be evaluated at a given value of $x$. For example, if $f(x) = 1 + x + x^2$, then $f(5) = 1 + 5 + 5^2 = 1 + 5 + 25 = 31$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polynomials are also added componentwise: If $f(x) = 1 + 4x + 4x^3$ and $g(x) = 2 + 3x^2 + 5x^3$, then $(f + g)(x) = (1 + 2) + 4x + 3x^2 + (4 + 5)x^3 = 3 + 4 + 3x^2 + 9x^3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Construct a polynomial with a variadic list of coefficients: the zeroth argument is the coordinate of the $x^0$'s place, the first argument is the coordinate of the $x^1$'s place, and so on. For example, `f = Polynomial(1, 3, 5)` should construct a `Polynomial` representing $1 + 3x + 5x^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to override the addition special method (`__add__`) and the callable special method (`__call__`).\n",
    "\n",
    "You should be able to emulate the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "f = Polynomial(1, 5, 10)\n",
    "g = Polynomial(1, 3, 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f(5))  # => Invokes `f.__call__(5)`\n",
    "print(g(2))  # => Invokes `g.__call__(2)`\n",
    "\n",
    "h = f + g    # => Invokes `f.__add__(g)`\n",
    "print(h(3))  # => Invokes `h.__call__(3)`\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, implement a method to convert a `Polynomial` to an informal string representation. For example, the polynomial `Polynomial(1, 3, 5)` should be represented by the string `\"1 * x^0 + 3 * x^1 + 5 * x^2\"`."
